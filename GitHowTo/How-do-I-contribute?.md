Contributions to the Kunena projects have never been easier. With our move to Github, the Kunena source code has become social.

What does that mean?

Very simple: You don't need to ask if you can help, you don't need to apply to join the team - all you do is you fork the repository of your choice. In your own fork you can implement and test any enhancements or fixes you would like to contribute. Once you feel your code is ready, just let us know by starting a pull request. The pull request informs the team that there is a new contribution ready to get merged into the main line of code.

Make sure you work in the proper branch.

So fork away and surprise us with great new features, enhancements, and bug fixes!

NOTE: When adding new translation strings only do the en-GB language files, others are maintained through Transifex.
